      <Paragraph>
        All components are available to consume as React components, exposed as modules on the npm registry. They
        encapsulate structure, style and logic which means that achieving a consistent look and feel across Skyscanner
        products on web, iOS and Android is as straightforward as: installing a package, importing it in a view and
        using it in JSX. Please see the Text component
        for <BpkLink href={`${ROUTES.TYPOGRAPHY}#text-readme`} blank>web</BpkLink> and&nbsp;
        <BpkLink href={ROUTES.NATIVE_TEXT} blank>native</BpkLink> as examples.
      </Paragraph>,
      <BpkBlockquote extraSpace>
        The recommended way to get started with Backpack on web is to
        use <BpkRouterLink to={ROUTES.BACKPACK_REACT_SCRIPTS}>Backpack React Scripts</BpkRouterLink>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Note:</strong> If you are looking to integrate Backpack components into an existing project, be
        aware that components are published uncompiled which means you&apos;ll need to accommodate for this in your
        webpack config.

    blurb: [
      <Paragraph>
        Backpack&apos;s bonds are primarily available as a library of Sass variables and mixins. Furthermore, most atom
        level components are also available as mixins. Again, the library is exposed as a module on the npm registry
        which can be installed like so:
      </Paragraph>,
      <BpkCodeBlock>
        npm install bpk-mixins --save-dev
      </BpkCodeBlock>,
      <Paragraph>
        The following example demonstrates how to import the module and consume the primary button mixin:
      </Paragraph>,
      <BpkCodeBlock>
        {`@import '~bpk-mixins/index';

.my-button {
  @include bpk-button;
}`}
      </BpkCodeBlock>,
      <BpkBlockquote extraSpace>
        <strong>Note</strong>: <BpkCode>bpk-mixins</BpkCode> only
        supports <BpkLink href={nodeSassUrl} blank>node-sass</BpkLink> and makes extensive use
        of <BpkLink href={sassLoaderTildeUrl} blank>sass-loader&apos;s</BpkLink> tilde importing mechanism. If you are
        not using <BpkLink href={sassLoaderUrl} blank>sass-loader</BpkLink>, you can
        use <BpkLink href={nodeSassTildeImporterUrl}>node-sass-tilde-importer</BpkLink>.
        The <BpkCode>indentedSyntax</BpkCode> option is unsupported.
      </BpkBlockquote>,
      <Paragraph>
        To get an idea of all the variables and mixins available, head on over to
        the <BpkLink href="/sassdoc" blank>full reference documentation</BpkLink>.

        We use the Craft plugin (from InVision) to help share components and keep Sketch files in sync. To use this:
      </Paragraph>,
      <BpkList ordered>
        <BpkListItem>
          Download and install the <BpkLink href="https://labs.invisionapp.com/craft" blank>Craft plugin</BpkLink>.

        <BpkListItem>
          Download the Backpack Craft library from <BpkRouterLink to={ROUTES.RESOURCES}>Downloads</BpkRouterLink>.
        </BpkListItem>
        <BpkListItem>
          Import the Backpack Craft Library into Sketch.
