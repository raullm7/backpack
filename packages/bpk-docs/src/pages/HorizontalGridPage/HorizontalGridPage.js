    <Paragraph>
      Backpack uses a 12 column responsive grid to compose and layout pages. Grids are composed using three basic
      building blocks: containers, rows and columns. Containers are used to encapsulate the entire layout (all rows).
      Rows are used to act as container to columns and columns are used to horizontally layout content.
    </Paragraph>,
    <BpkBlockquote extraSpace>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The Backpack grid is intended to be used for overall page layout as opposed to spacing
      out atom or molecule level components. Please stick to flexbox based techniques for more intricate
      layouts (or <BpkCode>display: table;</BpkCode> for browsers which lack support), just be sure to use the spacing
      values above in order to achieve consistency.

      <strong>Columns</strong>
    </Paragraph>,
    <Paragraph>
      The grid makes use of 12 percentage based columns, which means your layouts will scale no matter the browser
      size. Columns are separated by fixed width gutters and margins.

      <strong>Offsets</strong>
    </Paragraph>,
    <Paragraph>
      Offsets allow you to shift columns to the right. Depending on their size, columns can be offset by 1 through 11.

      <strong>Responsive behaviour</strong>
    </Paragraph>,
    <Paragraph>
      The grid works in conjunction with the breakpoints listed above and can be used to position content differently
      based on these viewports by specifying different widths and offsets.
